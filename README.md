# ScrapifyAPI
ScrapifyAPI is a lightweight web scraping and data-serving API built with FastAPI and BeautifulSoup. It extracts data from a website (e.g., quotes, jobs, or products) and exposes it via a REST API. The project demonstrates how to build a data ingestion + API layer â€” two crucial skills in data engineering.
